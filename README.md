# RetroHit

RetroHit is an open source Android App to test out APIs and HTTP REST Calls on the Fly.
Think of this like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) for Android.
The Project is 100% Kotlin.

### Proposed Features
- Make HTTP Requests such as `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, `PUT` etc.
- Test your REST API responses
- Choose type of Content to send as Body
    * Raw Data
    * Key Value pairs
- Add Custom Headers and Body Content
- Fetch Response Status and Headers
- Customizable request timeout, retry etc
